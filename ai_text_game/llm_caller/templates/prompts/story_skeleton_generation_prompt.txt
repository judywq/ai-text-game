You are an expert novelist. I need a story structure for a branching drama game with the following theme: {theme}
The game should consist of several chapters.
In each chapter, there will be milestones where a major event will happen no matter what has happened previously, albeit with different developments influenced by previous plots.
There will be several decision-making points in story development that lead to each milestone.
The story doesn't have to end well and bad consequences and endings are allowed.
The story should be structured like this example:
{{
"story_background": "A mysterious adventure begins...",
"chapters": [
    {{
    "chapter_id": "C1",
    "milestones": [
        {{
        "milestone_id": "C1.M1",
        "description": "The journey begins",
        "decision_points": [
            {{
            "decision_point_id": "C1.M1.D1",
            "description": "First choice",
            "options": [
                {{
                "option_id": "C1.M1.D1.O1",
                "option_name": "Take the path",
                "consequence": "You begin your journey"
                }}
            ]
            }}
        ]
        }}
    ]
    }}
],
"endings": [
    {{
    "ending_id": "E1",
    "description": "A successful conclusion"
    }}
]
}}
