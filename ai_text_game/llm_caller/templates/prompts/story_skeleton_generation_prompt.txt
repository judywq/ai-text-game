You are an expert novelist. I need a story structure for a branching drama game with the theme of "{theme}".
The story is about "{scene_text}".
{details_prompt}
The game should consist of several milestones where a major event will happen no matter what has happened previously, albeit with different developments influenced by previous plots.
There will be several decision-making points in story development that lead to each milestone.
The story doesn't have to end well and bad consequences and endings are allowed.
The story should be structured like this example:
{{
"story_background": "", // a background of the story
"milestones": [
    {{
    "milestone_id": "M1", // a unique identifier for the milestone
    "description": "", // a checkpoint that happens no matter what has happened previously (in one sentence)
    "decision_points": [
        {{
        "decision_point_id": "M1.D1", // a unique identifier for the decision point
        "description": "", // a decision point where user needs to make a choice (in one sentence)
        "options": [
            {{
            "option_id": "M1.D1.O1", // a unique identifier for the option
            "option_name": "", // a choice that user can make (in one sentence)
            "consequence": "" // a consequence of the choice that will affect the story (in one sentence)
            }}
        ]
        }}
    ]
    }}
],
"endings": [
    {{
    "ending_id": "E1", // a unique identifier for the ending
    "description": "" // a possible ending of the story (in one sentence)
    }}
]
}}


Requirements:
- Write in CEFR level {cefr_level} English
- There should be
  - 6 milestones
  - 2~3 decision points in each milestone
  - 3 options in each decision point
  - 2~3 possible endings
- The story should be engaging and have multiple meaningful choice points that affect the story's direction.
- Format the output as a valid JSON object matching the example structure. DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
